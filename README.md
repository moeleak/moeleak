I started programming when I was 11, dreaming of making a large 3D multiplayer open world game. Around 6 years ago I discovered AimTux and thus my game hacking journey began. It has been an unbelievable experience. Over time I realized that I am not the bad guy. I do feel guilt hacking in a match full of legit players. It is just not who I am. Dissecting the game and making it work at its fullest potential. That's what kept me in. I'd spend weeks coding something to make the game funnier. Cheating didn't interest me, coding did. This experience has equipped me with the ability to code. Now he's a student who is obsessed in OS, AI, game designing & hacking, whose major is computer science and technology<br>

You can find me on Mastondon easily. And if you want to know more about me you can visit my [blog](https://leak.moe) where you can find some topic about me.
